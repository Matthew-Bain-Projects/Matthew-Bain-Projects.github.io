## What is this? 
So, I was talking with one of my coworkers about programming deficiencies, and he mentioned that he thought we should move to Rust for our project. I am for the idea given its inherent safety features, but I am a bit nervous since Rust is basically a black box for me. I went through half of "the book" a few years ago, but all of that knowledge is long gone. I'm going to give it another try, and this time, I am going to see how far I can get in a month. Wish me luck. 

## Day 1: Hello, World!
Installing a workable rust environment is truly simple when working in a Unix ecosystem. Run a few commands, throw a party for our favorite crab, and boom! Workable programming environment. I need to figure out an ide, though. I'm not against vim (I am using it right now!), but I love the idea of walking through code, autocompletion, and other handy features I have come to rely on. Hopefully "the book" will give me some recommendations.
